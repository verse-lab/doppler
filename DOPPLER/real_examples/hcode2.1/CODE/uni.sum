Sorry to write in English. My typing in Hangul is very poor.

Once upon a time, there were two big guys named 
International Standard Org (ISO) and Unicode Consortium
(A US software and hardware vender consortium). Each of
them though he is the only one who can make a universal
code set so he planed to make it. DIS-10646 from ISO,
Unicode 1.0 from Unicode consortium were the names.

DIS-10646 was a super set of various National standards
in 32-bit space and Unicode 1.0 merges all Hanja used
in China, Korea and Japan and save the code space so
they can fit all possible characters in 16-bit space.

There couldn't be two suns in the sky and they reallize
that they should work together instead of fighting
against each others. May 1991 they agree to make one code set.

At this point, every work was done. Draft of International
standard becomes an IS-10646 by defining 16-bit space char(UCS-2)
(among 32-bit full-possible work space) identical to Unicode 1.1.
And Unicode 1.0 was added with more characters defined in old DIS.

So strictly speaking, Unicode 1.1 is just an implementation of
IS-10646 UCS-2 level 3.

Unfortunately Hangul space was restricted to 6566 Chars
(less than 19*21*28 ~ 11KB to cover all modern syllables).
In addition to 6566 "Precomposed Hangul Syllables"
(WanSungHyeong Hangul in common name in Korea),
240 Modern and Ancient Hangul Jamos (in 1100-11FF)
(90+1 Choseong, 1+66 Jungseong, 82 JongSeong)
were allocated in Alphabet space (0000-1FFF).
This Jamos will be combined to make a graphical
representation of un-precomposed hangul syllables.

Two volume books, Unicode 1.0, were the only information
published but Hangul part was changed so much that
you can't use the book. Changes from Unicode 1.0 to
Unicode 1.0.1 and some more informations can be found
from ftp@unicode.org. Two Mailing list, ISO10646@jhuvm.bitnet
and unicode@sun.com are alive but no so useful.
Final document, IS-10646 is in printing process.

If you need more information, please tell me at

Good Bye.
