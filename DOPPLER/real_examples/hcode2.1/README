Description:
-----------
Flexible        : you can put new hangul code without touching the program.
Efficient       : at least in my view point :-).
Simple 	        : The following is all of the main program !!
Hangul Code Conversion program.

main program:
-------------
    while ( (c=getc(fpin)) != (unsigned char) EOF ) {
        PrintChar = (*getwc)(c);
        if ( PrintChar != 0 ) (*prwc)(PrintChar,fpout,outCode);
        PrintChar = 0;
    }

Version:
--------
1.0 (Jan, 07, 1992)
1.1 (Feb, 29, 1992)
	.  Now support <IS>O-2022 for both input and output code.
	.  Change output code <I>nput Keyboard as Simulation <K>ey_input.
1.2^ (Oct, 04, 1992)
	.  Exit Status is supported.
	   if there is no hangul then it's 0, otherwise it's inCode.
	.  Romanization code is changed as the standard agreed by N.S. Korea.
1.3^ (Nov, 04, 1992)
	.  Main program has been changed as an automata
	.  printout2 has been introduced
	.  SI/SO for romanization code are {/}
2.0 (Dec, 6, 1992)
	.  Han3 and KSC5601-1989 Combination Coded supported
	.  Accept Roman and Key Simulation Code as input code
	.  Program uses function pointer so looks like C++
	.  Fixed size (4byte) Internal code has been introduced
	.  Hangul Codes supported by hcode are clearly defined
2.1 (Sep, 18, 1994)
	.  "\n" was added at the end of the signature of
	   IS-2022 code of SDN mailing code, "ESC$)C\n"
	.  Some bugs have been fixed to run it on INTEL machine.
	   (2 byte integer and byte ordering different than Sparc)

 This Program is free software under the GNU General Public License.
 If you are installing this program for your own work or other users,
 please send me a e-mail so that I can fix any possible bug and
 update for new Hangul Code including UNICODE.

Supported Hangul Code:
----------------------
 This program converts any possible Hangul code to another.
  hcode  [-A[B]]  [ in_file(-) [out_file] ]
  Choices of A-Input_Code and B-Output_Code
        <K>SC : KSC-5601-1987 with 8byte extension
              : also accepts Han3 Code in input mode
        <H>an3 : meaningful only for output code.
        <I>SO-2022-kr : Hangul Mailing Codes
        S<D>N : B_encoded_Header+\n+Body_in_ISO2022
        <T>rigem : 15 bit Trigem Combination Code
        <R>oman : Hangul Romanization Code
        <N>Byte : Old starndard in Unix system
        <S>im_Key : Simulation of 2 set Keyboard
                Version 2.0 By jylee@kitty.cims.nyu.edu

How to insert a new hangul code:
--------------------------------
 Moreover you can include ANY HANGUL CODE WITHOUT TOUCHING THE PROGRAM.
 Just insert your hangul code at the corresponding lines in h2Bcode.h
 (h3Bcode.h, h4Bcode.h) if it is 2Byte(Multi-Byte Hangul).
 And then define the name of code in hcode.h modify in(out)_choice.
 (cf) basically Input Hangul code must be sorted with order of KSC. 

Routines You may want to use for another Hangul Application :
-------------------------------------------------------------
hcode.c:
	main();
	extern void opt_check();
conv.c:
	extern unsigned long int t2k();
	extern unsigned long int k2t();
	extern unsigned long int c3h();
	extern unsigned long int convtr();
	extern unsigned long int convk8();
	extern unsigned long int convh3();
in.c:
	extern unsigned int gettr();
	extern unsigned int getks();
	extern unsigned int getiso();
	extern unsigned int getnb();
out.c:
	extern void pr2m();
	extern void pr3b();
mail.c:
	extern void rmprolog();
	extern void rmSDNheader();
	extern void putSDN();

How to get and install the program:
-----------------------------------
1 document : CODE.def, README, Makefile
2 program : hcode.c, conv.c, in.c, out.c, mail.c
3 head files : hcode.h, h2Bcode.h, h3Bcode.h, h4Bcode.h
4 Hangul Code Discussions : sample files in ./doc

ftp:anonymous@cair.kaist.ac.kr:/pub/hangul/codeconv/hcode2.0.tar.Z
ftp:anonymous@kum.kaist.ac.kr:/pub/hangul/hcode2.0.tar.Z
Or set me a e-mail I will send you it via e-mail with shar format.

Then compile by "cc -o hcode hcode.c conv.c in.c out.c mail.c".
Or just "make" in Unix machine.

Check if the hcode works well after compile:
--------------------------------------------
Try round trip compatability of your document as follows:
"hcode -AB your_file_in_A | hcode -BC | ... | hcode -CA | diff - your_file"
If your_file_in_A comforms the hangul code A, you should see nothing.
And if you have a terminal emulator which can deal all possible
hangul combination (Not hanterm2.21 but han3term or else)
then try "hcode -r? doc/try.roman", (for example, ?=h for han3term)

Living with /usr/ucb/Mail and SDN maing code:
---------------------------------------------
The following is the trivial example using "hcode" for people
living with /usr/ucb/Mail and SDN hangul mailing code:
If your system has "Grobal-aliases" or non-standard mailer then
please be sure that you understand what you are doing or don't try.

$HOME/.forward
        "| $HOME/bin/hcode -dk | cat >> /usr/spool/mail/your_login"
$HOME/.mailrc
        set editheaders
        set EDITOR=$HOME/bin/hvi		#any hangul editor
        set VISUAL=$HOME/bin/hvi		#any hangul editor
        set sendmail=$HOME/bin/mysendmail
$HOME/bin/mysendmail
        hcode -kd | /usr/lib/sendmail $*

Cf: All of above are shell program.  So you should remind that
    1.  $HOME in a shell-program means your home directory in full path
        for example /usr/group/your_name.
    2. hcode should be your excutable path (set path or setenv PATH).
        or you can tell the full path instead of just hcode.
    3. Don't delete "(double quotation mark) in .forward file.


Then you don't need to think about changing your code from
KSC to SDN (ISO-2022-KR) when you send it and vice verse
when you get it.  It's automatic and works well.



---------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------

The excutable code is stand alone application.
Any comment and bug reported will be appreciated.
Good luck.
